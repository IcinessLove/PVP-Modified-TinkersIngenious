## Tinkers' Ingenious Balance Adjustments

This is a modified version of 'TinkersIngenuity' (original by 'shenenxiaoyue'), based on release `1.0.0`. The changes were made by Diacletia with the goal of achieving a more balanced experience in PVP.

## Modifier Adjustments:

The damage absorption recovery speed of Knight Crystal [Chivalry] has been reduced. When performing a jump attack, for every 2 points of damage absorption consumed, it deals 1 additional point of damage.

The damage absorption increase effect of Knight Crystal [Knight Bloodline] has been removed. The new effect is: For each level, damage taken cannot exceed Max Health / (Max(5, 1 + 0.4 * Entry Level)).

Final Shell [Final Reinforcement] now provides 10% armor penetration per level for melee attacks and 2 fixed penetration for ranged attacks.

The damage increase effect of Coloured Glaze Star [Delicate] has been removed. Now, Coloured Glaze Star [PenetratingStar] ignores 8% of the target's protective effects per level.

The effect of Coloured Glaze Star [SpotLess] has been changed to remove all debuffs from the user every 8 / effect level seconds.

## Recipe Adjustments:

The crafting recipe for the BlowPipe and its components has been completely removed. If a balance plan for the blow dart is introduced in the future, it may be reconsidered for readdition.
